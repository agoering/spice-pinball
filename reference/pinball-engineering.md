## The Engineering Process

Engineering a pinball machine is done by following the engineering process, illustrated below:

## Pinball Engineering:

- **IMAGINE:** Brainstorm ideas for the pinball machine
- **PLAN:** Draw up a proposal including a diagram and a list of supplies
- **CREATE:** Make a prototype of your creation, one element at a time
- **IMPROVE:** Test your prototype, one element at a time. Modify anything that doesn’t work, and move on to the next element when you are satisfied.
- **PLAN, CREATE, IMPROVE** again and again!

## Prototyping Tips

Prototyping is making sure that adding a new element to your existing machine doesn’t break your code or overload your electronics. When prototyping, make sure not to overwrite your old sketch (make a new copy for every new element you add!). Here are the steps:

1. Add new element onto breadboard. Test that it works electronically as expected.
2. Write new element code
3. Test new code and make sure it doesn’t make existing elements stop working.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until you have a fully functioning electronic prototype.

## Installation Tips

After a working prototype exists, go step by step:

1. _Make a key with labels_
2. Plan installation sites and pencil them onto board.
2. Drill holes for wires
3. Measure and cut wires and label them on both ends with the element name
3. Solder, insulate, and label all elements
4. Install elements onto table in a "rough" way (don't glue them in yet - tape them on with painter's tape)
5. Organize wires (tape them along the bottom/back of table), mount breadboard on table, and reinstall wires
6. Rewire (onto breadboard, after the breadboard is mounted on the table)
7. Test elements on the table (without a ball) - look for any problems with soldering, insulation, etc before gluing anything in
7. Glue in parts
8. Organize wires: parallelize common wires (Vcc and GND lines especially)
9. Final test. Adjust thresholds or other parameters as needed
10. Play pinball and show off your skills!
