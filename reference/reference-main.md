This guide is for you! If you find yourself wishing for quick access to a snippet of code, a circuit layout example, or anything else, let us know on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1CZS4cuOhvA9gaFyjlWKAAf6xRf0unapmy681tcqHq-M/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank">suggestion form</a> and we will add it to this page! 

Our breadboard design (shown below) is shared [on Fritzing.org](http://fritzing.org/projects/spice-engineering-camp-breadboard) where you can download the .fzz file (install Fritzing to view) in order to see a breadboard view, schematic view, and parts list.

This awesome poster by <a href="cbrewste@uoregon.edu">Carolyn Brewster</a> outlines the most important circuit elements used in camp!

## A word on Arduino pins

> Arduino Nano pins A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 can actually be used as digital
I/O pins 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. The other analog pins A6 and A7 can only be used as analog inputs.



<!-- 
Missing documentation for piezo peak detector PCB. Here is the etch design:
/img/pcb_etch_piezo_peak_flipped.pdf 

Cody Jarrett has the rest still.

Also missing: diagrams (via Fritzing) for:

- IR setup
- FSR resistor
- Speaker amp
- Piezo peak detector
- Multinumber display (old)

Also want:

- Robust pinball template with Fritzing breadboard
- Link to this project on my LinkedIn
