You will be using this website to learn about electronics and programming. You can go back to any place in the site at any time, and there's also a page of quick references that might be useful to you as you build your pinball machine. 

As you go through the site, you'll encounter checkpoints. They look like this:

**_CHECKPOINT!_** 

When you finish a checkpoint task, check it off of your group's checkpoint list. Some of the checkpoint tasks will require you to check in with the instructor - you'll know which ones. 

Make any notes you think you might need for later. If there is anything you are confused about at each checkpoint, make sure to ask an instructor! It may also help to write down your questions and your answers, in case you forget and have the same question later. If there are enough questions on a single thing, we might add that to the reference page, so make sure to ask lots of questions as you go along!
