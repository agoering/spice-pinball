Over the next few days, we will use a lot of programs to learn about many different components and how to use them to build a pinball machine. But since this is your first
time programming an Arduino, we have pre-written most of the programs
for you. All you have to do is open them up and upload to the Arduino. 

Let's try using a simple program. In the Arduino software, go to **File > Sketchbook > Lights and Colors** and open **blink-led**. Then click on this button:

Now look at the LED. It should be blinking!

**_CHECKPOINT!_**

The program you loaded into
the Arduino told it to make the voltage on pin 12 go UP and DOWN, UP
and DOWN, once every second. This is why the LED
blinks.
