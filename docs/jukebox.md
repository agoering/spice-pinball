Now we will make a Jukebox.

Paste the following code in a new work area:

<a href="/sketches/s2_sh05c.txt">s2_sh05c</a>

Now open a new tab, name it ```mysongs.h```, and paste this into it:

<a href="/sketches/mysongs.h">mysongs</a>

Upload.

Buttons 0 and 2 should cycle through the numbers on the score board.
Button 1 should start playing the melody associated with that number.
Button 3 stops whatever is being played.

- Try adding more songs to your Jukebox. Use the higher numbers for them.
- Make a menu that shows the song name beside the song number.
