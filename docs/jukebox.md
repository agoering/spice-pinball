Now we will make a Jukebox.

Paste the following code in a new Arduino window:

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sketches/s2_sh05c.txt">s2_sh05c</a>

Now open a new tab in that window, name it ```mysongs.h```, and paste this into it:

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sketches/mysongs.txt">mysongs</a>

Upload.

Verify the following: 

- Buttons 0 and 2 should cycle through the numbers on the score board.
- Button 1 should start playing the melody associated with that number.
- Button 3 stops whatever is being played.

If you have time, here are some suggestions:

- Try adding more songs to your Jukebox. Use the higher numbers for them.
- Make a menu that shows the song name beside the song number.

**_CHECKPOINT!_**

Congratulations! You now have a functioning jukebox, and a head start to your pinball machine.
