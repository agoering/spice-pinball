In the next page, we will start programming a microcontroller
(Robot). But we need to learn about one more component before we
begin. It is called the **transistor**, and it has three legs.

One of the legs (the middle one) is called the **base**, and is used to control the amount of current flowing through the other two. You have to supply a small amount of current to the base to get current to flow. Here's an illustration:

To make the second red LED (connected to a resistor and a transistor) light up, use a wire to connect the base of the transistor to a high voltage as shown below. Ask an instructor for help if needed.

The circuit that you just made work is drawn like so:

Look back at the Breadboard internal connection sheet, and the way the components are plugged into the breadboard, and see if this matches the circuit diagram shown.
