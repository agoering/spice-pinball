Now, we are ready to control our electronics using a microcontroller
robot. The microcontroller we will be using is called an Arduino.

Look at the Arduino on your table closely. The most important things
to look for right now are the USB connector, and the pin
numbers. Those holes/sockets next to the numbers are what we are going
to use to connect the Arduino to our electrical circuits.

Now, we will program an Arduino. To do this, first connect the Arduino
to your computer using the USB cable.
Then, launch the Arduino programmer by clicking on this icon:

You should see a window open that looks like this:

This blank white space is where we can write our programs. But before
we do that, let us connect our Arduino to the first circuit we played
with. 

First, disconnect the power supply to the breadboard. Then, use
a jumper wire to connect the Arduino pin labeled **GND** to any of the
blue-line (0 volts) rows on the breadboard. Then, disconnect the 5
volts wire you previously connected to the red-line row, and instead plug that end into the Arduino pin labeled 12.

Do not connect the power supply back to the breadboard before an instructor has okayed your wire connections.
