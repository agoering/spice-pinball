- Breadboard with the following setup:
    - Power supply
    - Arduino
    - 4x momentary switches
    - 1x buzzer or  computer speaker
    - 1x NPN transistor
    - 1x green LED
    - 1x 1k resistor for green LED
    - 1x 200 ohm resistor for transistor base
- Sensor Kit:
    - 1x infrared emitter/receiver (TCRT5000), pre-soldered to resistors
    - 1x large momentary switch
    - 1x piezo sensor
    - 1x 1M resistor to read piezo (connect in parallel)
    - 1x force sensitive resistor
    - 1x 10k resistor for FSR (connect as voltage divider, FSR high)
- Also on this board (though not used in this session):
    - 2x shift registers
    - 8x red LEDs
    - 8x blue LEDs
    - 16x 10k resistors for shift register LEDs

We will ignore this bit today:

The Session A materials are still there in case you want to go back to them. Today's sketches will be in **File > Sketchbook > Sounds and Senses**
