Welcome to the electronics and programming learning center! Return to revisit sessions as you please, or visit the reference page for quick access to frequently-needed info.

As you go along, you’ll encounter checkpoints. They look like this:

**_CHECKPOINT!_** 

Some checkpoints will require you to check in with the instructor - you’ll know which ones. Otherwise, simply move along as you feel ready - and ask lots of questions as you go along!

You will be doing challenge activities at the end of each session. Do your best to complete these, as only practice can build coding skills! However, we will release solutions for the challenge activities at the end of each session. There will be a new password for each session's Mods. 

Here are the links for each session:

<!-- You will be using this website to learn about electronics and programming. You can go back to any place in the site at any time, and there's also a page of quick references that might be useful to you as you build your pinball machine. 

As you go through the site, you'll encounter checkpoints. They look like this:

**_CHECKPOINT!_** 

When you finish a checkpoint task, check it off of your group's checkpoint list. Some of the checkpoint tasks will require you to check in with the instructor - you'll know which ones.  -->

<!-- Make any notes you think you might need for later. If there is anything you are confused about at each checkpoint, make sure to ask an instructor! It may also help to write down your questions and your answers, in case you forget and have the same question later. If there are enough questions on a single thing, we might add that to the reference page, so make sure to ask lots of questions as you go along! -->
