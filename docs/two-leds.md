Now, we will control two LEDs at the same time.

Make the connections to pins 12 and 11 as shown.

Now upload two program **two-leds**. Watch the LEDs, read the program and figure out what it does. 

Try making the following modifications (save as **two-leds-mod** in your **Mod** folder first!).

1. Change the pins from 12 and 11 to 10 and 9.
2. Change the order so LEDa turns on, LEDb turns on, then LEDa turns off, and finally LEDb turns off. 
3. Change the time for which the second LED stays on.
