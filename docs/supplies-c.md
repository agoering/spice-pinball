Today we will learn to use a special chip that will be helpful in making our pinball machines. Also, today's setup can be used directly as a model for how to read many inputs and write to many outputs - and it can be used with a few modifications as a direct model for the pinball electronics that you will build.

SPICE breadboard, which should look like this:

Additionally, every table must have received a SPICE scoreboard, which should look like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/scoreboard-front.png" style="width: 500px"/>

For the first bit, we will focus on this part of the breadboard:

Today's sketches will be in **File > Sketchbook > Patterns and Loops**
