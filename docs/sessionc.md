Today we will learn to use special chips that will be helpful in realizing our pinball machines.

Every table should have been provided with breadboards with the following components on them:

- Two 74HC595 shift registers (Black 16 pin chips)
- One 74LV4051 multiplexer    (Black 16 pin chip)
- Nine tactile push buttons
- Eight Red LEDs
- Eight Blue LEDs
- One Green LED
- Several 1kOhm resistors
- Many jumper wires
- 5 Volts regulator assembly

Additionally, every table must have received a buzzer equipped Spice score-board.

The breadboard should look like this:
