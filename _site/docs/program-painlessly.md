# Good Morning!

---

## This morning we're going to do three things:

- Write skeleton programs
- Share pinball designs, ideas, and challenges
- Share programs on SPICE-hub

---

## Skeleton Programs

### Most of our programs come down to one operation:

```if (CONDITION == TRUE){
    doVERB();
}
```

---

## Skeleton Programs 
### Add five points when button is pressed

```if (cupcake == LOW){
    addfivepoints();
}
```

**Every verb should have a corresponding function**

---

## Skeleton Programs

### Write a program that's empty except for names of functions, then add functions one by one!

Example: Jukebox

---

## SPICE-hub

- Write your pinball table name, and a description for your code in a comment at the start of your program
- Give your program a short but descriptive name
- Put your code on my USB in the folder called **SPICE-hub**
- I'll put your code on the website!
