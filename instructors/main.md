## So you want to do an electronics camp?

We would love for our course content to be used, reused, and remixed! Our activities may be helpful as written, and our Pinball library and SPICE Sketchbook are available online. The next pages will walk educators through installation of those files, and additional pages here go into more depth about the electronics and programming elements.

There are lots of other awesome resources for DIY electronics online. We recommend:

- [Arduino official site](http://www.arduino.cc/)
- [AdaFruit, a super cool resource for parts and great tutorials](http://www.adafruit.com/)
- [SparkFun, for more cool supplies](https://www.sparkfun.com/)
- [Fritzing, an open source breadboard-modeling, circuit-diagramming, and even PCB-making tool!](http://fritzing.org/home/)

If you want to share what your projects, ideas, code, or more, get in touch with us (see the footer for contact info)!
