## Need a Hint?

You'll learn the most when you solve challenges on your own. But if you get totally stuck, or want to see what we had in mind, the challenge solutions are available on [Github](https://github.com/agoering/spice-instructor) in the **Mods** folder.

Solutions to the challenge problems are also hosted on Dropbox. They are password-protected so you can release solutions after everyone has given the challenges a solid effort. They might be a little different because they haven’t been edited along with the rest of the content. Inform us if/when you come across that issue. Here are the links and passwords:

## Managing Student Content

It is probably a good idea to make sure to save student work on a syncing system. I would again recommend Dropbox or Google Drive for something like this. Considerations for how to set up such a system include:

- Share-ability: see everyone’s code, reuse everyone’s code
- Edit-ability: permissions required to edit code
