## So you want to host an electronics camp?

We would love for our course content to be used, reused, and remixed! 

Our activities may be helpful as written, and the [Pinball Library](https://github.com/dileepvr/spice-pinball) and [SPICE Sketchbook](https://github.com/agoering/spice-arduino) which accompany them are available online. You can contribute by asking their owners (Dileep or Andrea) to become a collaborator (message them on Github to get set up).

The next sections will walk educators through <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/instructors/spice-libraries">installation</a> of those libraries and discuss the setup of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/instructors/spice-chromebooks">SPICE Chromebooks</a>.

In this section you will also find information about <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/instructors/camp-admin">SPICE Engineering administration</a>. We also have additional suggestions for ways to modify the curriculum to make it shorter (our camp is a two week course culminating with Pinball machines, but there are lots of fun day and multi-day projects buried within!). 

There are lots of other awesome resources for DIY electronics online. We recommend:

- [Arduino official site](http://www.arduino.cc/)
- [AdaFruit, a super cool resource for parts and great tutorials](http://www.adafruit.com/)
- [SparkFun, for more cool supplies](https://www.sparkfun.com/)
- [Fritzing, an open source breadboard-modeling, circuit-diagramming, and even PCB-making tool!](http://fritzing.org/home/)
- [Deal Extreme for great deals on specialty/pre-assembled electronics](http://www.dx.com/)
- [DigiKey for great deals on basic electronics](http://www.digikey.com/)
