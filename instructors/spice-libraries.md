## What are SPICE Libraries?

The Pinball Library is a collection of Arduino functions useful for pinball programs, that work with the specific electronic components we use in camp. The SPICE Sketchbook is a collection of Arduino sketches used in these tutorials. 

### Installing the Pinball Library

1. Quit Arduino if it is open. Download the zip file from [https://github.com/dileepvr/spice-pinball](https://github.com/dileepvr/spice-pinball)
2. Unzip contents into the Arduino Libraries folder. This should create a folder called spice-pinball in the Libraries folder. (You can also place this into the Sketchbook folder with no ill effects).
3. Rename the spice-pinball folder "Pinball" (be sure to capitalize the 'P').
4. Open the Arduino IDE, and check the popup list File->Examples for your new 'Pinball' library.

### Installing the SPICE Sketchbook

1. Download the zip file from [https://github.com/ayocom/spice-arduino](https://github.com/ayocom/spice-arduino). 
2. Unzip contents and place folders directly into the Arduino folder (not the libraries folder). 
3. Rename the spice-arduino folder "Spice" (be sure to capitalize the 'S').
4. Open Arduino. The SPICE sketches should now be accessible via **File >> Sketchbook**

### If your Arduino has a counterfeit FTDI chip

**Mac OSX**: See [here](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/5119/arduino-nano-no-serial-port-for-macbook-air-2013), at Mekku's answer.
