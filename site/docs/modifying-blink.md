Try to modify the Blink program in the following ways:


1. Change the pin being used from 12 to 11, or 10. Remember that you'll have to move the pin on the Arduino if you change the program!
2. Change the amount of time between blinks. Can you make it so the
LED stays on for one second (1000 milliseconds), but stays off for
half a second (500 milliseconds)?
3. Cut all the lines inside the ```loop()``` function and move it into the
```setup()``` function. What does this program do? Try pressing the reset
button on the Arduino. Can you explain what the LED is doing?
4. Move the lines back into the ```loop()``` function, and change the pin
back to 12. Now, try and make the LED do a more complicated blink
pattern, of your choice. This will be good practice for your pinball machine, so write down what you did!

**_CHECKPOINT!_**

Now, change the pin back to 12 for the next part.
