That white/yellow board with holes is called a **breadboard**.

A breadboard is used to quickly make and test circuits. We built some breadboards ahead of time for this session, with components already plugged in. 

The holes on the breadboard have stripes of metal inside them like so:

We can use these stripes of metal to make connections between our
components. The red line holes are kept at 5 volts, and the blue-line holes are kept at 0 volts (0 volts is also called **ground**, sometimes shortened to **GND**). Those lines are convenient ways to connect to power from any point on the board without requiring many long wires. 

The smaller sets of holes are connected as shown. To test how the smaller sets of holes work, look at how the LED and the resistor on the far left (close to the power source) are plugged in.

With the jumper wires given to you, connect the 5 volt line to the circuit as shown to make the LED glow. If you want to take out the LED to double-check which leg is long and which short, do so.
