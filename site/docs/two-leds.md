Now, we will control two LEDs at the same time.

Disconnect the power supply to the breadboard, and make the connections to pins 12 and 11 as shown.

Now upload the following program, and power the breadboard back up.

Can you read the program and figure out what it does? Try making
the following modifications:

1. Change the pins from 12 and 11 to 10 and 9.
2. Change the order so the second LED turns on before the first one turns off, and the second LED turns off before the first LED turns on.
3. Change the time for which the second LED stays on.
4. Change the pins back to 12 and 11.
5. Make your LEDs follow a rhythm, maybe to the beat of your favorite song.
