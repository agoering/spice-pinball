        This is the website for the SPICE Engineering camp, a summer science camp for middle-school kids, being conducted by the Oregon Center for Optics and partners on the campus of the University of Oregon.

    During the camp, participants design and build pinball tables using basic electronic sensors and circuits. Yes, we know, that's awesome!
