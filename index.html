		This is the website for the SPICE Engineering camp, a summer science camp conducted by the Oregon Center for Optics on the campus of the University of Oregon. [Visit the SPICE mothership](http://spicescience.uoregon.edu/) to get in on the fun!

		During the camp, participants design and build pinball tables using basic electronic sensors and circuits. Check out our learning materials under the **Learn** tab, and for more details and information on other ways to use the material, check out the **Teach** tab. 

		Until next time, always remember to be nice to robots. â™¥
